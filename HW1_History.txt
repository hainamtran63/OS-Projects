Missed Question 1 - 2nd attempt:

1) 
A universal computer can simulate an arbitrary machine on a given arbitrary input while
dedicated processors are machines assigned to a single operation. Thus universal computers 
have much more variety than dedicated processors.

2)
History of Electronic Computers:
a) Mechanical Calculators
R. Shickard - father / real creator of the first mechanical calculator
B. Pascal - celebrated creator of the first mechanical calculator
G. Leibniz - inventor of binary & creator of the "stepped reckoner" machine
C. Babbage - father of the computer & invented the first mechanical computer

b) Programming
J. Jacquard - created first programable machine/loom
Ada Byron Lovelace - mathematician & first computer programmer

c) Computability
K. Goedel - father of the mathmatical concept of a recursive function
A. Church - created Lambda Calculus & helped Goedel with recursive functions
E. Post - created computability theory using symbolic logic to solve problems
A. Turing - Father of theoretical computer science & artificial intelligence

d) Electronic Computers
J. Atanasoff - invented first electronic programmable calculator/computer
K. Zuse - Created first programmable electronic computer & the first high level programming language 
J. von Neumann - Designed the architecture of the modern computer. Design structure of processors, cpu,
		 internal and external memory as well as input and output.

e) Personal Computers
S. Wozniak - Co-founder of Apple. Designed first machines at Apple and influenced Macintosh
S. Jobs - Co-founder of Apple. Helped create first Apple products and influenced Apple's growth.
